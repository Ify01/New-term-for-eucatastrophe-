"eustórslys" is the term.


Eucatastrophe is sudden and favourable resolution of events in a story; a happy ending.
And J. R. R. Tolkien coined the word by affixing the Greek prefix eu, meaning good/well, to catastrophe. 
In order to avoid the unfortunate connotations of the word as it is currently because when many people hear the word, it just sounds like someone pronouncing the word “catastrophe” in an odd way.
I would love to give my little suggestion, still using the the Greek prefix "eu" I would affix "stórslys" an Icelandic word meaning for "catastrophe". 
We now have "eustórslys" meaning  a sudden and favourable resolution of events in a story; a happy ending.
